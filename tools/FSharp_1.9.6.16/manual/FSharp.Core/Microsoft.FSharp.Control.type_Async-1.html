 An asynchronous computation, which, when run, will eventually produce a value 
 of the given type, or else raise an exception. The value and/or exception is not returned 
 to the caller immediately, but is rather passed to a success continuation, exception continuation 
 or cancellation continuation. 

 Asynchronous computations are normally specified using the F# 'workflow' syntax for building 
 computations.

 When run, asynchronous computations can normally be thought of as running run in one of
 two modes: 'work item mode' or 'waiting mode'.

    - 'work item mode' indicates that the computation is executing as a work item,
      e.g. in the .NET Thread Pool via ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem, or is running
      a brief event-response action on the GUI thread. 

    - 'waiting mode' indicates the computations a waiting for asynchronous I/O completions,
      typically suspended as thunks using ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject. 

 Asynchronous computations running as 'work items' should not generally perform blocking
 operations, e.g. long running synchronous loops. However, some asynchronous 
 computations may, out of necessity, need to execute blocking I/O operations: 
 these should be run on new threads or a user-managed pool of threads specifically 
 dedicated to resolving blocking conditions. For example, System.IO.OpenFile is, by 
 design, a blocking operation. However frequently it is important to code as 
 if this is asynchronous. This can be done by executing Async.SwitchToNewThread
 as part of the workflow.

 When run, asynchronous computations belong to an AsyncGroup. This can usually be specified 
 when the async computation is started. The only action on an AsyncGroup is to raise a cancellation 
 condition for the AsyncGroup. Async values check the cancellation condition for their AsyncGroup 
 regularly, though synchronous computations within an asynchronous computation will not automatically 
 check this condition. This gives a user-level cooperative cancellation protocol.
